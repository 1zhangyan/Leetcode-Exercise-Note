# 3Sum

Leetcode Note

-------

> **Problem Description:**
>Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? 
>Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
>The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

## Idea:

Original Ideal : The problem can be transformed to selecting three elements whose sum are 0 from the given array. There will be or so $n^3$ groups of elements waiting for us to test whether their sum is zero. What troubles is that we will get some duplicate triplets (there might be some same elements in the given array).So we have to consider some ways to filter these duplicate triples. 
We can process by maintain three pointers:

- First pointer -i always point to the first element we chose from the array.(this pointer will traverse the array)
- Second pointer -low always point to the next element of the one first pointer point to.
- Third pointer -high always point to the last element of the array.

Sort the array fisrtly. Then we can fix the first pointer and calulate the sum of elements i,low,and high point to.Try all possible position i,low and high may point to and get the right triples.During the moving of the three pointers, if the next position they are going to move to has the same value of the current position, just jump the next posiotn and keep moving.By this way we can reduce the duplicate triplets.

## Code:
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<vector <int>> ret;
        vector <int> temp(3);
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        int len = nums.size();
        int i=0;
        int high = 0;
        int low = 0;
        for(i=0;i<len-2;i++)
        {
            if(nums[i]>0)
                break;
            if(i>0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1])
                continue;
            high = len-1;
            low = i+1;
            while(high>low)
            {
                int sum = nums[i]+nums[low]+nums[high];
                if(sum == 0)
                {
                    temp[0]=nums[i];
                    temp[1]=nums[low];
                    temp[2]=nums[high];
                    ret.push_back(temp);
                    low ++;
                    high --;
                    while(nums[low] == nums[low-1]&&low<high)
                        low++;
                    while(nums[high] == nums[high+1]&&low<high)
                        high--;
                }
                else if(sum < 0)
                {
                    low++;
                    while(nums[low] == nums[low-1]&&low<high)
                        low++;
                }
                else
                {
                    high--;
                    while(nums[high] == nums[high+1]&&low<high)
                        high--;
                }
            }
        }
    return ret;
    }
};
```
