# 2sum
leetcode Note

--------------------------
> **problem description:** 
>Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
>Example:
>Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
>Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
>return [0, 1].


# Ideas:
When I first consider this question, I thougt of sorting the arry. After that, find the first biggest element A that less than target.Then find if there is an elemnet B from the smallest one making the sum of A and B is equal to target.If the answer is 'no', just using the second biggestelement repeating the above action.Since when we using quick sorting algorithm,the index of the array will not match the original order,I create another array to save the index and the array changes in the same rythem as the one in the quicksorting algorithm.This solution can not show a good performance.
Another good idea is to use unordered_map.Create an empty map first. Then traverse the array find if there is element in the map making the sum is equal to the target.If not, insert the current array element into the hash map.
# Code:
```c++
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <iostream>
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    unordered_map<int,int>  hashx;
    auto end=hashx.end();
    vector<int> solution(2,0);
    for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++)
    {
        auto find=hashx.find(target-nums[i]);
        if(end==find)
        {
            hashx.emplace(nums[i],i);
        }
        else
        {
            solution={find->second,i};
        } 
    }
         return solution;
    }
};
```
