# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Double-pointer Hashmap

-----------------------------

> ***Problem description:***   
>Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.  
> Example 1:  
> Input: "abcabcbb"  
> Output: 3   
> Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.    

# Idea 
As for this problem, we can use two pointer to get the longest substring without repeating characters.  
- The first pointer, which points to the first unrepeating character.  
- The second pointer, which will traverse all the string points to current element can be the last element in the required substring. 
At the same time, maintain a variable to record the length of the longest substring till now. In order to improve the performance of the algorithm, we can use hashmap to enhance the speed of seeking if there is the repeating element.   

# Code
```c++
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
      map<char,int> hashx;
      auto end=hashx.end();
      int size =0;
      int n=s.length();
      for(int j=0,i=0; j<n; j++)
      {
          auto find = hashx.find(s[j]);
          if(find!=end)
          {
              i=max(find->second,i);       
          }
               hashx[s[j]]=j+1;
               size=max(size,j-i+1);   
      }
      return size;
      }
```
***Tips:***
* When using map , be sure which element in the map is key and which one is value. Since function 'find' will just find the key, map will get value via the found key. Select which kind of element should be key and which value.
* When insert the pair into a map, we can use function 'insert' , 'emplace' or straight use 'map[key]=value;'. But if we use the first two function insert the an existing key ,the operation fail and the new pair will not be insert in. If we use 'map[key]=value;' the key will upgrade.
